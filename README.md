# Belly Button Biodiversity Interactive Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide an interactive dashboard for exploring the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes inhabiting human navels. The dataset reveals the presence of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in different individuals, with some OTUs being common among more than 70% of people.

# Interactive Dashboard can be accessed here
- [https://yakopeca.github.io/belly-button-challenge/](https://ashley-ley.github.io/belly-button-challenge/)

## Dataset Information

- The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset is available in the `samples.json` file.
- Key attributes in the dataset include:
  - `names`: Subject IDs
  - `metadata`: Demographic information for each subject
  - `samples`: Microbial data for each subject

## Installation and Dependencies

To run this interactive dashboard, you will need:
- A modern web browser
- The files located in this repository

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the dropdown menu to select a subject ID.
3. After selecting a subject ID, you will see the demographic information of the subject along with two visualizations:
   - A bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs present in the subject's navel.
   - A bubble chart showing the distribution of OTUs, with larger circles representing more abundant bacteria.
